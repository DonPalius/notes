monozygotic twins in same environment, mono chorionic vs bi placenta, IQ diffs,
80s Benbow & Stanley, Johns Hopkins, on 40,000 gifted kids, Math SAT distributions 13:1 boys, Reader's Digest "Math gene".
Environment was NOT the same.

Adopted kids...same environment tests, cross-fostering for centuries.

Seymour Ketey, Harvard  (Schizophrenia, nutty ideas)

Scandanavian Data awesome, synergism 1,3,9,17% heritability including criminal, alcohol behavior.

Problem: kids taken away as soon as born, prenatal env,
Princeton: adoptive placements are non-random...agencies try to match the kids.

Identical twins separated @ birth  U Minn Tom Bouchard, Behavioral Geneticists.  Problem: tiny difficult sample size

Prenatal: environment does NOT begin at birth.  Locke was a dumbass, and so was BF Skinner.

Puberty vs young/old vs medium aged mothers...less estrogen = later puberty
Brain smaller if mom was stressed.  Gluccocortizoids higher if thalmus smaller.  Grandmother effect...Genesis Onanism!
non-Mendellian transmission of traits

Dutch Hunger Winter 1944.  Metabolic programming / imprinting, a _ _ phenotype, Pancreas stores insulin, kidneys,

born good at storing salt, thrifty metabolism,   19x incidence of obesisty, etc.  Fetal Origins of Adult Diseases, new field

Stalingrad Hunger similar births.  Epigenetic changes in insulin secretion proven
Phytoestrogens, breast cancer, for generations.

Learning: fetus fluid drink flavors, Fetuses hear mom inside,
Darlene Francis, Princeton, Cross Fostering Fetuses!  High anxiety mom-hosts pass it on, not genetic.

How control for that?  look at father & mother.

Mitochondria have their own DNA.   Lynn Margulis U Mass, MC used to be independent organisms.  Eve hypothesis.

another Asymmetry: Imprinted Genes, Transcription factors, LAMARCKIAN TRAIT...passes on acquired trait for generations via environmental toxins

Introversion vs Extroversion, mediated by physical traits in between?
Social rank: bird feathers irredecence

70% heritability of Political Party affiliation: vs affinity for Ambiguity, Kohlberg

Aggressiveness: lower threshhold for pain sensitivity

Epigenetic....suppression of transcription factors, critical.  Michael Meaney, McGill U, pick up rat and pet it, bigger brain,

neonatal handling

Seymour Levine, Stanford U psych 1960, showed pet rat's mother changed if pet for 3 mins vs 1.5 hrs.ï»¿

```
Lamarkian inheritance of imprinted genes
Appearance, height; more positively treated, more extrovert
Plummage inheritance causes social rank
Political preferences- ambiguity tolerance is inherited
Aggression-pain sensitivity!
Epigenetics; dutch hunger winter 3rd trimester
Mother's style;neonatal handling. generational-more licking grooming of pups for your kids

Multigenerational consequences of early experience/prenatal events

Twins -mono and dizygotic raised together and apart, mono and bichorionic placenta. Adoption studies- nonrandomness of allocation. Common traits (schiz study)
Prenatal environment; nongenetic inheritance
hormonal influence on age of puberty based on age of foetal sac, number of neighbouring brothers, glucocorticoids- lasts for generations! anxiety in womb,notDNA!
nutrients-metabolic programming
resonating mum's cat in hat
prenatal effects= mother-father(false paternity,mitochondrialDNA, TFs)
